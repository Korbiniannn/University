    Comments over multiple lines are done
    like so (or with """). Usually, every
    function signature is followed by a
    comment block, before the function body.

    The next few lines are so called 'doc tests'
    in python (https: /realpython.com/python-doctest/).
    These look like the interactive shell in python
    and resemble test cases that demonstrate correct
    useage and correct results for the current function.
